# Mapy

MapReduce has been kept me stimulated on distributed computations since I was in first year of my bachelors degree. Here I have implemented a generic mapreduce framework in python. I'm still eveluating whether to lead this towards,

  - A kernal level implementation, or
  - An open protocol for distributed computations.

This projec has the following components,
    
  - Mapy Core - Acts as somewhat similar to a controller that directs map - reduce functions to get computations done.
